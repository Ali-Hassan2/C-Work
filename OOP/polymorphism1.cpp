    // operator overloading at the compile time polymorphism the compiler is clear that whic function
    // will be called first and which one will not be called the decision is taken at the time of 
    // the compile time that which function will be called first.
    // The compiler bounds the function that which function will be called 


    // Run-time compilation and 
    // in this  this is acheived by the virtual functions and and the compiler postponds the decision 
    // that which function will be called at the first call and after the compilation you will come
    // to know that which function will be called at the first and
    // at the runtime there is not binding involved and all the decision taken after the compile
